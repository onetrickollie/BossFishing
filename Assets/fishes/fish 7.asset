  fishDescription: "Known for its motto, \u201CI\u2019m nobody\u2019s catch,\u201D
    this aquatic diva takes no bait, dodges nets with flair, and still finds time
    to lecture the ocean on self-care. Martilapia built its own coral castle from
    scratch (thank you very much) and hosts nightly stand-up routines for starfish
    and seahorses alike"
