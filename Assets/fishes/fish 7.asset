  fishDescription: "Meet Patrick, the chill fish who\u2019s often left on the sidelines.
    While others swim in the spotlight, Patrick floats quietly, waiting to be noticed.
    He\u2019s a kind and laid-back guy\u2014always happy to be there. Maybe Patrick
    is the catch you didn\u2019t know you needed."
