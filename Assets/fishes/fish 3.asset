  fishDescription: the small but fierce shark with a sleek blue-silver sheen that
    glides through the water like a streak of lightning. He might show his teeth
    if necessary, but deep down, Koifish are playful, full of energy, and but also
    laid-back and always ready to curl up for a nap when the moment strikes.
