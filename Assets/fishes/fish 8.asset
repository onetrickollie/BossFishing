  fishDescription: "a light grey fish that\u2019s always just floating, taking it
    easy, and soaking in the peaceful waters around her. She\u2019s not the fastest
    swimmer, which makes her an easy catch, but her relaxed demeanor makes her hard
    to resist. Boss loves these kinds of fish, always reeling them in with a smile."
